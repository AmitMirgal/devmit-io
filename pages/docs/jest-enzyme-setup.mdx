## What is jest?

Testing framework created by facebook.

## What is enzyme

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.

Enzyme's API is meant to be intuitive and flexible by mimicking jQuery's API for DOM manipulation and traversal.

## Getting started

If you are using React with 16 version then you need to install enzyme adapter to bind React with enzyme

To get started with enzyme, you can simply install it via npm. You will need to install enzyme along with an Adapter corresponding to the version of react (or other UI Component library) you are using. For instance, if you are using enzyme with React 16, you can run:

`npm i --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16`

#### Add dependencies

Add jest to your project. To do that, run;  
`npm install jest`

Add enzyme, run  
`npm install enzyme`

#### Create setupTests.js file at src directory and add the following code into it.

```javascript
import { configure } from 'enzyme'
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })
```

#### Sample test file using jest and enzyme

Note - Testing PrimaryButton component

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { mount } from 'enzyme'

import PrimaryButton from './PrimaryButton'
import { emptyFunc, emptyString } from '../../../commons/utils/emptyLiterals'

describe('<PrimaryButton/>', () => {
  let wrapper
  const defaultProps = {
    className: emptyString,
    label: 'Submit',
    onClick: emptyFunc,
    disabled: false,
  }
  const prepare = (props) => {
    wrapper = mount(<PrimaryButton {...defaultProps} {...props} />)
  }

  it('button element exists', () => {
    // when
    prepare()

    //then
    expect(wrapper.find('button').exists()).toBe(true)
  })

  it('button is enabled', () => {
    // when
    prepare()

    //then
    expect(wrapper.find(PrimaryButton).props().disabled).toBe(false)
  })

  it('button is triggered', () => {
    const props = {
      onClick: jest.fn(),
    }
    // when
    prepare(props)

    wrapper.find(PrimaryButton).simulate('click')

    //then
    expect(props.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled()
  })
})
```
