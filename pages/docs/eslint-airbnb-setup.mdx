## What is Eslint?

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## What is eslint-config-airbnb

This package provides Airbnb's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.

## Getting started

#### Add dependencies

Add eslint to your project. To do that, run;  
`npm install --save-dev eslint`

Add eslint-config-airbnb, run  
`npm install --save-dev eslint-config-airbnb`

Also to install the peer dependencies of airbnb, run;  
`npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb`

#### Create .eslintrc file in the root directory

`{ "extends": "airbnb" }`

If you are using VSCode then install ESlint extension and you are ready to use the linter.

Note - If you are not able to use the warning on the js file as you type,

1. Go to - vs code settings
2. search for work directories
3. Once you find the settings.json add the following line into that file  
   `"eslint.workingDirectories": [ { "mode": "auto" } ]`
